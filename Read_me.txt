Student ER diagram is the architecture for the students_database we are going to use. It contains a detailed overview of the tables, columns and generates an abstract model for the relationships implemented in the database.                                                               
student_database is the extensive relational database that will be used to run various SQL codes. The required framework for this will be MySQL.

student_task 1, 2 and 3 contains the SQL programs and procedure respectively. I have designed these problems to better showcase the structure of my database with all its features and see problem solution from a data analytics perspective.

My_worksheet will display all the student_tasks using Tableau. All the diagrams can be altered by interacting with the department filter I have provided. The filter can be arranged with a combination of any number of departments to showcase the complexity of a business database.
