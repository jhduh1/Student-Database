                                                                student_database

1. student_database is the extensive relational database that will be used to run various SQL codes. The preferred framework for this will be MySQL.

2. student_task 1, 2 and 3 contains the SQL programs and procedure respectively. I have designed these problems to better showcase the structure of my database with all its features and see problem solution from a data analytics perspective.

3. My_worksheet will display all the student_tasks using Tableau. All the diagrams can be altered by interacting with the department filter I have provided. The filter can be arranged with a combination of any number of departments to showcase the complexity of a business database. 

4. My_worksheet can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jawad.duhit#!/vizhome/Myworksheet_15770268437560/Dashboard1?publish=yes
